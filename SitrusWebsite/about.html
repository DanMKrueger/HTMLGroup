              We are a small startup company that started in a small office in Basking Ridge New Jersey.
              Our founder, Justin Rojas, came up with this idea while back and we decided to pursue creating the
              website together. The idea came to Justin when he was wondering how to get started after getting
              his degree in Computer Science and realizing how difficult the field was for entry level workers.
              He decided to create an application that would advertise you as your desired profesion, and people
              that needed profesional help from someone with that skill set could get your help and you could make
              money at the same time. The app/website was designed to be helpful for everyone, and we always welcome
              new ideas to make our company even better!
